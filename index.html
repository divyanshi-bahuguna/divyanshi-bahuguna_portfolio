  <h2>👋 About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Hi, I’m <b>Divyanshi Bahuguna</b>, a first-year <b>B.Tech Computer Science and Engineering (AI)</b> student at 
    <b>Galgotias University (2024–2028)</b>. I specialize in <b>Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and 
    Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)</b>, with a strong interest in <b>Open-Source Contribution</b> and 
    <b>Software Development</b>.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    I began coding during school and became comfortable with <b>Java</b> and <b>Python</b>, along with hands-on 
    experience in <b>Web Development</b>. Over time, I’ve participated in multiple hackathons and solved daily 
    <b>DSA problems</b>, which has fueled my love for <b>problem-solving</b> and <b>building real-world applications</b>.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    Currently, I’m working on diverse projects—from creating intelligent optimization algorithms to building full-stack 
    web apps like <b>FindIt</b> (a Lost & Found platform for students). I enjoy designing user-friendly interfaces, 
    integrating backend logic, and learning new technologies through open-source collaboration.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    My long-term goal is to grow as a developer, contribute to impactful projects, and work on technologies that make 
    life easier and smarter for people.
